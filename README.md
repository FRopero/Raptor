# auto-UAV

This project belong to Fernando Ropero, PhD Student at the Computer Engineering Department, Universidad de Alcal√°. The purpose of this project is to integrate an autonomous controller executing high-level layers and a functional layer executed on an onboard computer in a UAV.

The files commited in this repository are referred to the functional layer of the UAV. The goal of this layer is to communicate the high-level layers of the autonomous controller with the UAV. Then, it receives actions from the high-level layers, it translates to the low-level layer's language and then, send them to execution.
